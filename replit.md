# Skin Care AI Chat Assistant

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides AI-powered skin care consultation through a chat interface. The application features an AI assistant named "Bonnie" that analyzes skin conditions and provides personalized recommendations based on dermatological knowledge. It's built using React with TypeScript for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and integrates with Google's Gemini AI for intelligent responses.

    * Start Final: Users who send messages but don't reach the final message with buttons
    * View Final: Users who see the final message with buttons but don't click them
  - Removed artificial 1000 session limit - now analyzes ALL sessions for accurate totals
  - All metrics respect temporal date filtering and display as absolute numbers (no percentages)
  - Dashboard now shows correct totals matching session count with real interaction data
