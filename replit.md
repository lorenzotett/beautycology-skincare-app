# Skin Care AI Chat Assistant

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides AI-powered skin care consultation through a chat interface. The application features an AI assistant named "Bonnie" that analyzes skin conditions and provides personalized recommendations based on dermatological knowledge. It's built using React with TypeScript for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and integrates with Google's Gemini AI for intelligent responses.
